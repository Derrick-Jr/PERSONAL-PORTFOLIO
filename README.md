 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Medical Laboratory Science student at Kenyatta University, driven by a desire to merge clinical expertise with computational intelligence. I explore the intersection of healthcare and emerging technologies to create solutions that matter.

> “In the Lab, I analyze samples to find answers. In Code, I analyze logic to build solutions — both are about making a difference.”
